# pixeljump

Created this for a school project.

Didn't have to, but just for fun I implemented an ECS engine for this game, plus
a bunch of systems and components that work on top of pygame. Feel free to use
it if you want (But please don't, it's an unoptimized mess that should not be
included in anything remotely serious). It is licensed under MPLv2.0, so as long
as you don't introduce any changes to the files you only have to include a
copyright notice in your project. If you apply changes to the files from this
repo in your project, those changes must be licensed under MPLv2.0. For details
